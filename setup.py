Pyacq is a simple, pure-Python framework for distributed data acquisition and
stream processing. Its primary use cases are for analog signals, digital
signals, video, and events. Pyacq uses ZeroMQ to stream data between
distributed threads, processes, and machines to build more complex and
scalable acquisition systems.
